# Technical Decisions & Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the key technical decisions made during the development of TalentFlow, a React-based hiring platform that meets all requirements of the technical assignment.

## ‚úÖ Requirements Compliance

### 1. Jobs Board Implementation
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Server-like pagination with title, status, and tags filtering
- **CRUD Operations**: Create/Edit in modal with validation (title required, unique slug)
- **Archive/Unarchive**: Status management with visual indicators
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Optimistic updates with rollback on 0.5% simulated failure
- **Deep Linking**: `/jobs/:jobId` routes with proper navigation

### 2. Candidates Management
- **Virtualized List**: react-window implementation for 1000+ candidates
- **Search & Filter**: Client-side name/email search, server-like stage filtering
- **Profile Routes**: `/candidates/:id` with complete timeline
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop stage transitions with visual feedback
- **@Mentions**: Notes with mention suggestions from local candidate list

### 3. Assessment System
- **Question Types**: Single-choice, multi-choice, short text, long text, numeric with range, file upload stub
- **Live Preview**: Real-time rendering of assessment as fillable form
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide questions based on previous answers (e.g., Q3 only if Q1 === "Yes")
- **Validation Rules**: Required fields, numeric ranges, max length constraints
- **Local Persistence**: Builder state and responses stored in IndexedDB

### 4. Data & API Layer
- **MSW Implementation**: Complete REST API simulation with all required endpoints
- **IndexedDB Persistence**: Dexie wrapper for local data storage
- **Network Simulation**: 200-1200ms artificial latency, 5-10% error rate on writes
- **Write-through Pattern**: MSW acts as network layer, writes to IndexedDB

### 5. Seed Data
- **Jobs**: 30 jobs (exceeds requirement of 25) with mixed active/archived status
- **Candidates**: 1,000 candidates randomly distributed across jobs and stages
- **Assessments**: Multiple assessments with 10+ questions each, various question types

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### State Management
**Decision**: Zustand over Redux
**Rationale**: 
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Built-in persistence support
- Better TypeScript integration
- Smaller bundle size

### API Simulation
**Decision**: MSW (Mock Service Worker) over MirageJS
**Rationale**:
- Intercepts actual network requests
- Works in both development and production builds
- Better debugging experience
- More realistic network behavior simulation

### Persistence Layer
**Decision**: Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper)
**Rationale**:
- Better performance than localStorage for large datasets
- Structured query capabilities
- Transaction support
- Handles 1000+ candidates efficiently

### Virtualization
**Decision**: react-window over react-virtualized
**Rationale**:
- Smaller bundle size (2.5kb vs 27kb)
- Better performance for simple use cases
- Maintained by same team
- Simpler API

### Styling
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design tokens
- Built-in dark mode support
- Smaller CSS bundle with purging

### Form Handling
**Decision**: Custom form components over libraries
**Rationale**:
- Full control over validation logic
- Better integration with conditional questions
- Smaller bundle size
- Custom requirements for assessment builder

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

### Virtualization Strategy
```typescript
// Virtualized list for 1000+ candidates
<FixedSizeList
  height={600}
  itemCount={candidates.length}
  itemSize={120}
  itemData={{ candidates, onSelect }}
>
  {CandidateItem}
</FixedSizeList>
```

### Optimistic Updates
```typescript
// Immediate UI update with rollback on failure
const handleReorder = async (fromOrder, toOrder) => {
  // Optimistic update
  updateJobsOrder(fromOrder, toOrder);
  
  try {
    await api.reorderJob(jobId, { fromOrder, toOrder });
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback on failure
    revertJobsOrder();
    toast.error('Reorder failed');
  }
};
```

### Memory Management
- Only render visible items in virtualized lists
- Cleanup event listeners in useEffect
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Use React.memo for pure components

## üîß Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Drag & Drop with Optimistic Updates
**Problem**: Need immediate feedback but handle network failures
**Solution**: 
- Update UI immediately
- Store original state
- Rollback on API failure
- Show appropriate error messages

### Challenge 2: Conditional Questions in Assessment Builder
**Problem**: Complex dependency management between questions
**Solution**:
- Dependency graph tracking
- Real-time preview updates
- Validation of circular dependencies
- Clear visual indicators

### Challenge 3: 1000+ Candidate Performance
**Problem**: Browser performance with large datasets
**Solution**:
- Virtualization with react-window
- Efficient filtering algorithms
- IndexedDB for fast queries
- Pagination fallback for non-virtualized views

### Challenge 4: Network Simulation Realism
**Problem**: Make mock API feel like real network
**Solution**:
- Variable latency (200-1200ms)
- Random error injection (5-10%)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Realistic response delays

## üìä Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action ‚Üí Component ‚Üí API Call ‚Üí MSW Handler ‚Üí IndexedDB ‚Üí Response ‚Üí UI Update
                ‚Üì
         Optimistic Update (immediate)
                ‚Üì
         Rollback on Error (if needed)
```

### Example: Job Reordering Flow
1. User drags job to new position
2. UI updates immediately (optimistic)
3. API call to `/api/jobs/:id/reorder`
4. MSW simulates network delay + potential failure
5. On success: Keep optimistic update
6. On failure: Rollback + show error
